Title: Identification of Cell-Type-specific Spatially Variable Genes
        accounting for excess zeros.

Description: The R package CTSV implements the algorithm proposed by Jinge Yu and Xiangyu Luo that detects cell-type-specific spatially variable genes accounting for excess zeros. CTSV directly models raw count data through a negative binomial model and performs hypothesis testing based on R package pscl. The package aims to provide p-values and adjusted q-values for genes in each cell type for bulk ST data, and CTSV is scalable to datasets with tens of thousands of genes measured on thousands of samples. CTSV can be installed in Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.
